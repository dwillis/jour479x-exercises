# The Very Basics of R

R is a programming language, one specifically geared toward statistical analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain built in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The first, and most basic, is the console.

Think of the console like talking directly to R. It's direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we'll get into later. For now, try typing this into the console 
```{r}
2+2
```
Congrats, you've run some code. It's not very complex, and you knew the answer before hand, but you get the idea. We can compute things. We can also store things. In programming languages, these are called variables or objects. We can assign things to variables using `<-`. And then we can do things with them. Try this in your console. 

```{r}
number <- 2

number * number
```
We can have as many variables as we can name. We can even reuse them (but be careful you know you're doing that or you'll introduce errors). Try this in your console.
```{r}
firstnumber <- 1
secondnumber <-2 

(firstnumber + secondnumber) * secondnumber

```
We can store anything in a variable. A whole table. An array of numbers. A single word. A whole book. All the books of the 18th century. They're really powerful. We'll exlore them all semester long. 

### Adding libraries

The real strength of any given programming language is the external libraries that power it. The base language can do a lot, but it's the external libraries that solve many specific problems -- even making the base language easier to use. 

For this class, we're going to need several external libraries. We'll mostly use two libraries for analysis -- dplyr and ggplot2. To get them, and several other useful libraries, we can install a single collection of libraries called the tinyverse. Type this into your console: `install.packages('tidyverse')`

Then, to help us with learning and replication, we're going to use R Notebooks. So we need to install that library. Type this into your console: `install.packages('rmarkdown')`

You may have to quit and restart R Studio. I honestly can't remember. 

### Notebooks

For the rest of the class, we're going to be working in notebooks. In notebooks, you will both run your code and explain each step, much as I am doing here. 

To start a notebook, you click on the green plus in the top left corner and go down to R Notebook.

To add text, simply type. To add code you can click on the *Insert* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

To run your code after you add it, click the green triangle on the right side of your code chunk. 

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Assignment

Create an R notebook. In it, fill in the top matter and write a sentence below it. Don't care what. Then add a code block and add two numbers together. Run that code block. Save the file and submit the .Rmd file created when you save it. That's it. Simple.
