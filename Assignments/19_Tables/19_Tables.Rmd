# The simplest data visualization: The table.

But not a table. A table with features. 

Sometimes, the best way to show your data is with a table. R has a neat package called `formattable` and you'll install it like anything else with `install.packages('formattable')`. 

So what does it do? Let's gather our libraries and get some data. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(formattable)
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
total18 <- "http://www.cfbstats.com/2018/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category10/sort01.html"

totalOffense18 <- total18 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table') %>% 
  html_table()

totalOffense18 <- totalOffense18[[1]]

total17 <- "http://www.cfbstats.com/2017/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category10/sort01.html"

totalOffense17 <- total17 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table') %>% 
  html_table()

totalOffense17 <- totalOffense17[[1]]

totalOffense18$Year <- 2018

totalOffense17$Year <- 2017

totalOffense18 <- totalOffense18 %>% rename(Rank=1)
totalOffense17 <- totalOffense17 %>% rename(Rank=1)


totalOffense <- rbind(totalOffense18, totalOffense17)
```

Let's ask this question: Which college football team saw the greatest improvement in yards per game this regular season? The simplest way to calculate that is by percent change. 

```{r}
changeTotalOffense <- totalOffense %>% select(Name, Year, `Yards/G`) %>% spread(Year, `Yards/G`) %>% mutate(Change=(`2018`-`2017`)/`2017`) %>% arrange(desc(Change)) %>% top_n(20)
```
We've output tables to the screen a thousand times in this class with `head`, but formattable makes them look good with very little code. 

```{r}
formattable(changeTotalOffense)
```

So there you have it. Illinois improved the most. Because we gave them a quarterback. But I digress. First thing I don't like about formattable tables -- the right alignment. Let's fix that. 

```{r}
formattable(changeTotalOffense, align="l")
```

Next? I forgot to multiply by 100. No matter. Formattable can fix that for us. 

```{r}
formattable(
  changeTotalOffense, 
  align="l",
  list(
    `Change` = percent)
  )
```

Something else not great? I can't really see the magnitude of the 2018 column. A team could improve a lot, but still not gain that many yards (ahem, UTEP). Formattable has embeddable bar charts in the table. They look like this. 

```{r}
formattable(
  changeTotalOffense, 
  align="l",
  list(
    `2018` = color_bar("#FA614B"), 
    `Change` = percent)
  )
```
That gives me some more to mess with. 

One thing you can do is set the bar widths to the results of a function. In this case, it returns a number between 0 and 1, with 1 being the max and 0 being the minimum. It gives you some idea how far out UTEP is with their peers. 
```{r}
unit.scale = function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

formattable(
  changeTotalOffense, 
  align="r",
  list(
    `2018` = color_bar("#FA614B", fun = unit.scale), 
    `2017` = color_bar("#FA614B", fun = unit.scale), 
    `Change` = percent)
  )
```

Another way to deal with this -- color tiles. Change the rectangle that houses the data to a color indicating the intensity of it. Again, UTEP stands out.

```{r}
formattable(
  changeTotalOffense, 
  align="r",
  list(
     area(col = 2:3) ~ color_tile("#FFF6F4", "#FA614B"),
    `Change` = percent)
  )
```
