Sometimes we get data that is not already summarized that we need to summarize in order to answer questions. 

Today, let's look at [MLS Salaries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-YB7vtpK_TKFI4cySBPk8_jrLhYO1wOmn5QXPRgyoo/edit?usp=sharing). Major League Soccer is very good about publishing the salaries of each player in an easy to use format. 

While knowing the salary of each player is useful, we need context. We need to have some questions answered, like: 

* Which team has the highest payroll?
* Which team has the higest average salary?
* Which team has the highest median salary?
* Which position group is the most expensive by median salary? Least?

When faced with information we need to summarize, in spreadsheets we rely on something called a pivot table. They're enormously powerful and simple to use, once you get over how to get what you want. 

First, watch this walkthrough:

Now answer the questions above using the [MLS Salaries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-YB7vtpK_TKFI4cySBPk8_jrLhYO1wOmn5QXPRgyoo/edit?usp=sharing) data. You'll have to make a copy of the data for yourself in Google Docs. Write a paragraph summarizing your answers in narrative form -- in other words, whole sentences. Submit your narrative for the assignment.
