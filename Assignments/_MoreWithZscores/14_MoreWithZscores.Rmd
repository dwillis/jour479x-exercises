# In Class: Taking your composite further

Grab your notebook and data from Tuesday. You have two tasks in this class. You can divide them. 

1. How meaningful to the outcome of the season are your measures? Did you choose meaningful measures or not? Use correlations that we've done in previous examples.

2. Is Nebraska better than any team remaining on the schedule based on your composite? Rank Nebraska's remaning opponents using your measure. Then, as a group, predict the remaining games. Which ones could they win? Which ones won't they win? Use your composite as a guide, and note where you disagree. 

Submit a single R Notebook.
