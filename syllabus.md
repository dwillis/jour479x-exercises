__Course description:__  

Like few other industries on the planet, sports is awash in data and the amount of new data is exploding. With that explosion of data, communicators now more than ever need the skills to analyze and understand data to then produce the stories hidden in the information. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information -- to look at sports: the games, the seasons, the leagues, the players. We’re going to get our hands dirty with the tools of analysis.

__Prerequisites:__

A grade of C or better in SPMC250 or instructor permission.

__Required Materials:__  

* A functioning laptop computer that you must bring with you to class every time and ~1 GB of free hard drive space.
* The administrative privileges to install software on your computer.
* Online materials and class handouts, as needed.
* Slack, installed on your computer and on your phone.

__Learning opportunities:__  

The graded work in this class is as follows:

|Assignment|Percentage of your grade|
|----------|------------------------|
|Two sports data presentations|40%|
|Data challenges|50%|
|Pop quizzes|10%|

_Sports data presentations_: You will be required to pitch and execute two sports data presentations on your own during the semester. The presentations must include original analysis of data you have obtained, a graphic or visualization of that data, a written summary of what you found and a verbal presentation of that data and analysis.

_Data challenges_: Regularly throughout the semester, there will be challenges covering an analysis or visualization topic. The challenge will incorporate the materials from class and require you to apply them. Each challenge will have a required outcome that will help you in your presentations and the course outcomes.

_Pop quizzes_: To reinforce the in-class lectures and the course readings, there will be occasional pop quizzes. They will be short, multiple choice and on Canvas.

_Class participation and attendance_: You are bad at college if you don't know what this means. Get involved in class, speak up, ask questions, challenge ideas and, most importantly, show up. This is how I determine who gets rounded up when you have an 89.4 and who doesn't. Skip class and you won't get any benefit of the doubt. 

Other learning opportunities:

_News Nerd Slack_

I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a way for students to get help from each other and me when we're not in class or not even in the building. I have one News Nerd Slack that includes my current code class, students of past classes and alumni who have gone on to do data journalism professionally. You'll be added to the slack during the semester, and at the end, I'll remove you unless you tell me otherwise. If you like it, stay. If not, no worries and no judgements.

_Maker Hours_

The opportunities in this class are to experiment with storytelling in a way you have never done before. Creativity and ambition will be rewarded. Copy and pasting will not.

As such, this class will require to you try a lot of things on your own. If you've never done this before, it can be a little daunting starting out. To help you, I've set up a time called [Maker Hours](http://www.makerhours.org) where you can come, hang out, learn something new and get help with it. It's most Friday afternoons, Room 27, Andersen Hall. This time is open to any student wanting to learn programming, data viz, hardware hacking -- anything in the digital journalism space that can help them tell stories. It's not required for you to show up at Maker Hours, but if you're struggling, stuck, frustrated or just really interested in learning more, come hang out. I promise you it's worth the time.

__Learning outcomes:__  

* Master basic data analysis
* Experience the tools of sports analysis, including statistical languages and visual presentation.
* Master the use of data in sports storytelling
* Master basic data visualization for sports storytelling


__ACEJMC Competencies__

After this class, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;
* Think critically, creatively and independently;
* Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;
* Write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the communications professions, audiences and purposes they serve;
* Critically evaluate their own work and that of others for accuracy and fairness, clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness;
* Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts;
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.

__Academic integrity:__  

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

*  Handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
*  Turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
*  Turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
*  Using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions.
Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.  

__Students with disabilities:__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.  

__Recording of Lectures/Discussions__

So as to create a classroom environment in which everyone may feel comfortable participating in discussions, it is expected that no audio or video recordings of class will be made without the prior knowledge and consent of the instructor.  Students with disabilities for which reasonable accommodation would include making such recordings should work with the Services for Students with Disabilities office and the instructor to make arrangements.

__Diversity and Inclusiveness__

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation.

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity in the broadest sense - gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic status, physical and intellectual ability, religion, education and geography. We recognize that acknowledging, building understanding and incorporating diversity throughout the curriculum prepare students for communications careers in a global society. As communicators, we know journalism, advertising, public relations, broadcasting and other forms of strategic communications must reflect society in order to be credible, reliable and effective. Inaccuracies or biases in our written, spoken and visual reports mean we have failed as journalists. Diverse voices and perspectives improve our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising and public relations, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create inclusive communications that reflect a diverse society.

__Trespass Policy (Regents' Policy 6.4.7)__

The areas of University academic, research, public service, and administrative buildings of the University used for classrooms, laboratories, faculty and staff offices, and the areas of University student residence buildings used for student living quarters are not open to the general public. Any person not authorized to be or remain in any such building area will be deemed to be trespassing on University property, and may be cited and subject to prosecution for criminal trespass in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat., § 28-520 or § 28-521.

## Classroom emergency preparedness and response information

__UNL Alert__

UNL Alert provides free notification by landline, cell phone, text message, e-mail, fax, and pager during an emergency. Visit http://emergency.unl.edu for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to UNL. If you receive a UNL Alert notification during class, please share the information immediately.

__Additional Information__

Additional information about emergency preparedness and response at UNL as well as the university's operating status can be found on emergency.unl.edu.

__WEATHER EXTREMES__

* Listen to the latest National Weather Service warnings and bulletins on radio and television.

__During a Tornado__
* When sirens activate, move to the lowest, interior area of building or designated tornado shelter.
* Stay away from windows.
* Stay near inside wall when possible.
* Keep calm. Even though a warning is issued, the chance of a tornado striking your building or location is slight.

__During a Winter Storm__
* If conditions worsen during the day, the administration may decide to close the university early. When such determination is made, you will be notified through UNL Alert, campus email, and UNL's Web site.
* Decisions to close for the day are communicated usually by 6 a.m.
* If roads leading to your home have been closed, caution should be used in determining whether to travel home.

__MOBILITY ASSISTANCE__

* Anyone who needs/wants help with moving to evacuation or shelter-in-place locations should let me know.  
* I will locate volunteers students in this class who will assist you in the event we evacuate or shelter-in-place

__SHELTER-IN-PLACE (Hostile Intruder, External Hazardous Materials Release)__

* Remain calm.
* If it is possible to flee the area safely and avoid danger, do so.
* Notify anyone you encounter to exit the building immediately. Evacuate to a safe area away from the danger and take protective cover. Stay there until help arrives.
* Call UNL Police Department or 9-1-1 with your location if possible.  If you cannot get through by phone and have text message capability, text University Police at 41513.  Enter the letters UNLPD and then type your message. Dispatch will receive and respond to the message.
* If flight is impossible, secure yourself in your space. Barricade doors and block windows. Turn off all the lights, close blinds and close and lock all windows and lock and barricade all doors.
* Seek protective cover for yourself and any others (concrete walls, thick desks, filing cabinets may protect you from bullets).
* Keep calm, quiet and out of sight.
* Silence cell phones (mute or turn off cell phone ringer).  Consider turning off radios and computer monitors.
* Do not answer the door. If you do not recognize the voice that is giving instructions, do not change your status (stay put). Unknown or unfamiliar voices may be false and designed to give false assurances.
* Place signs in exterior windows to identify the location of injured persons.
* Do Not Approach Emergency Responders-let them come to you.
* Remain where you are until an "all clear* instruction is given by an authorized known voice.

__EVACUATION (Fire, Internal Hazardous Materials Release)__

* Always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds.
* In the event of an evacuation, gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, cell phone, NCard, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit.
* Do not use the elevator.
* Move away from the problem, use alternative exits.
* Help those who need assistance moving.
* Be ready to be guided by additional instructions.
